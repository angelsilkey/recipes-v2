    <h1 class="headers">Ghost Rice Krispy Treats</h1>
    <p>Adorable crispy rice ghosts for Halloween? Also super easy to make? Count me in! Stamping out and decorating the ghosts is the best part.</p>

    <h1 class="headers">Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 stick plus 2 tablespoons (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li><br>
        <li>One 12-ounce bag marshmallows</li><br>
        <li>5 cups crispy rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies</li><br>
        <li>8 ounces white chocolate, roughly chopped</li><br>
        <li>45 chocolate chips</li><br>
        <li>White sanding sugar, for decorating</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="headers">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><br>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the marshmallows and cook, stirring frequently, until melted and completely smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the cereal until combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared sheet pan. With wet hands, evenly press the mixture into the pan until packed in tight. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Using a 3.5-inch ghost-shape cookie cutter, stamp out 15 ghosts and transfer to a wire rack set inside another rimmed baking sheet. Place any scraps in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at low power until they are pliable again, about 15 seconds. With wet hands, press the scraps back into the parchment-lined baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Use the cookie cutter to stamp out as many more ghosts as possible. Repeat with any scraps, if desired.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the white chocolate to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted, about 1 minute 30 seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Spread some of the melted chocolate on top of each ghost then sprinkle with the white sanding sugar until covered. For each ghost, press in 2 chocolate chips for the eyes and 1 chocolate chip for the mouth. Let sit until the white chocolate hardens, about 10 minutes. Serve or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
