    <h1 class="headers">Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>One 3.4-ounce package instant vanilla pudding</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>50 chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos (about 21.45 ounces)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>Gummy worms, for decorating</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="headers">Directions</h1>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Combine the pudding mix and milk in a large bowl and whisk constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Meanwhile, add the cookies to a food processor and process until fine crumbs form. Remove 4 cups and set aside. Drizzle the butter into the remaining crumbs and pulse until mixture starts to hold together when pinched between your fingers. Pour into a 2 1/2-quart glass bowl and pack with the bottom of a measuring cup to form an even layer. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Beat the cream cheese and confectionersâ€™ sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until no lumps remain, about 2 minutes. Beat the cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the cream-cheese mixture until well combined, then fold this mixture into the pudding until well combined.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Pour half of the pudding mixture over the cookie crust and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle with half of the reserved cookie crumbs, then top with the remaining pudding mixture and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle with the remaining cookie crumbs, decorate with the gummy worms and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Serve cold.</p>
